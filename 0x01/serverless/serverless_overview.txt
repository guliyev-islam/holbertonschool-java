# Serverless and Cloud Architecture - Lecture Summary

## What is Serverless Architecture?

Serverless architecture is a cloud computing model where developers build and run applications without managing servers. The cloud provider automatically handles server provisioning, scaling, and maintenance, allowing developers to focus purely on code.

## What is Function as a Service (FaaS)?

FaaS is a serverless computing service that executes code in response to events. Functions are stateless, event-driven, and automatically scaled. Examples include AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, and Google Cloud Functions.

## Benefits of Serverless Architecture

- **Cost Efficiency** - Pay only for actual execution time and resources used
- **Automatic Scaling** - Instantly scales from zero to thousands of concurrent executions
- **Reduced Operational Overhead** - No server management or infrastructure maintenance required

## What is Cloud Computing and Its Benefits?

Cloud computing delivers computing services over the internet, including servers, storage, databases, and software. Benefits include scalability, cost reduction, accessibility from anywhere, automatic updates, and disaster recovery.

## Main Differences Between Architectures

**Monolithic**: Single deployable unit, shared database, tight coupling
**Microservices**: Multiple independent services, service-specific databases, loose coupling
**Serverless**: Event-driven functions, no server management, extreme scalability, stateless execution
