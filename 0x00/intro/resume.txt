# Microservices Architecture - Lecture Summary

## What are Microservices?

Microservices are an architectural approach that structures applications as a collection of small, independent, loosely-coupled services. Each service is responsible for a specific business function and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

## Overview of Monolithic and Microservices Architecture

**Monolithic Architecture** builds applications as a single deployable unit where all components are interconnected and interdependent. Changes require redeploying the entire application.

**Microservices Architecture** decomposes applications into multiple small services that communicate over well-defined APIs. Each service runs in its own process and can be developed using different technologies.

## Benefits of Microservices Architecture

1. **Independent Scalability** - Scale individual services based on demand rather than the entire application
2. **Technology Diversity** - Use different programming languages, databases, and frameworks for each service
3. **Fault Isolation** - Failure in one service doesn't necessarily bring down the entire system

## Types of Communication Between Microservices

- **Synchronous Communication**: Direct HTTP/REST API calls, gRPC
- **Asynchronous Communication**: Message queues, event streaming, publish-subscribe patterns
- **Database-per-Service**: Each microservice maintains its own database for data independence
